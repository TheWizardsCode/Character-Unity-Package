In this demo our characters will initially wander, randomly. However, there are a number of objects that have a happiness stat influencer on them. Some will improve the characters happiness some will reduce it.

Characters will remember the effects of these places, avoiding the ones they don't like and revisiting the ones they do like when they need cheering up.
