The Cues System allows the game to provide instructions to actors. These instructions control the characters movements and animations They do not change the actors statistics (see Behaviours and Interactables).

In this scene we have a single actor and a director. The actor responds to cues from the director, moving between three points. The director has a looping set of three cues, clicking the cue button in the UI will loop through these.
