This scene demonstrates how to give a character emotions. These emotions can then be used to influence animations that play.

There are not sufficient animations in the pack to truly demonstrate the behaimpact of this system (see video below). It includes a series of poses that will at least show movement in the character, but don't exect it to look good. It is designed to show how you might control those emotions in gameplay.

For a better understanding of what is possible check out my video describing what happens when this is integrated wth a talking character: https://youtu.be/HnFmDeWkzNQ

Also note that at the time of writing this scene requires UMA to be in your project. We'll remove that dependency at some point and replace it with another character (patches welcome).
