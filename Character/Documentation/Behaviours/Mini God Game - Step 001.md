In this Mini God Game you are a god. Though not a very powerful one. Your goal is to keep your people happy and alive. There's very little you can do to influence their lives. You can tell them what to do, they have free will.

You can, however, influence the world they live in.

You start out with 2 people in your population. Fortunately, one is male and the other is female. Your first job is to encourage them to build a house. to build a house they will need wood. So plant a few trees.

Simply point and click to place objects.

The two characters have different personalaties and favour different kinds of work. They will chop trees down, build houses and more. But work takes up alot of energy. When they are tired they will rest.

When they have collected enough wood they will build a house and will be able to go to sleep and rest properly.

If their energy levels go too low they will start to loose health. If their health reaches 0 he will die.

If you click on a character you can see what they are doing, how long the task will take and what their current stats are. You can also adjust their current stats. You can't, however, given them orders. You must instead influence their decision making by changing their stats and manipulating their enviornment.
