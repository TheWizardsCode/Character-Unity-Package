The `241 Village Life` scene has a number of interacting characters that live together in a village. This scene demonstrates how objects in the world can have their own stats.

## Workplaces

* Farm - enjoyable work that produces raw materials that are sold in the farm shop
* Farm Shop - boring work in which farm produce is sold

## Workers

TODO: currently workers will each do any of the jobs available to them, rather than having a single assigned job.

* Neo Farmer - works at the Farm
* Neo Cook - works in the Restaurant
* Neo Trader - Buys and sells things for profit, in this village she will purchase raw food from the Farm shop and sell it to the restaurant and social club
