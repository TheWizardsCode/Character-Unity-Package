# Emotions

The Emotions scene demonstrates how a characters animations can be influenced by their emotional state. For a quick introduction see https://youtu.be/HnFmDeWkzNQ

At the time of writing we do not have animations to show off the emotional animation behaviour. Therefore all that you can see at the moment is the demo UI for controlling emotions and the output that this has for animation controller parameters.

We look forward to your contributions in the form of feedback, code and animatioss that will demonstrate this functionality out of the box.

## Installation

The `Scenes/Emotions` scene will work out of the box. However, the animation controller does not have animations that respond to these emotions, therefore you can only see and change the emotional control values on the screen. 
You can download free animations from Mixamo or use any other animations you have available, simply override the included demo animation controller and add your animations to it.

At the time of writing Salsa does not provide a Scripting Define Symbol, we've requested that a future update include one. For now, if you have Salsa installed for Lip Syncing, you need to add "SALSA" to your Scripting Defines Symbols.
